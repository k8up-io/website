We collect inputs for the agenda in a [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O687amnDyQIXReeeKkylzxWgq1BZ7tZdIQN0-x3ca5g/edit?usp=sharing) document.

The general agenda is:
* Ask the maintainer
* Discuss roadmap

Currently, we donâ€™t do any recordings of the meeting, until the community wishes to do so.
