To report a vulnerability, please report it on GitHub directly.

You can follow the procedure described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability):

* Navigate to the [security tab](https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/security) on the repository
* Click on 'Advisories'
* Click on 'Report a vulnerability'
* Detail the issue

The reporter(s) can typically expect a response within 24 hours acknowledging the issue was received.

If a response is not received within 24 hours, please reach out to any [maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/k8up-io/teams/maintainer/members) directly to confirm receipt of the issue.
